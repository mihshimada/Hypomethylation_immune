# 2025_hypomethylation_immune
This repository contains the python scripts used in a study exploring hypomethylation in immune-mediated diseases.

The programs in this repository are the ones we used in our research (doi: ). Its purpose is to format and analyze data from a merged file that includes the results of sample chaining using [TALON](https://github.com/mortazavilab/TALON) and the output file from [SQANTI3](https://github.com/ConesaLab/SQANTI3). Although there may be less versatile programs since we did not aim to provide an analysis pipeline, we will do our best to address any inquiries and are open to modification for your use.

## Python Requirements
Python >= 3.7
